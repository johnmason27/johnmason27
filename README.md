### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I work at PebblePad as a Apprentice Application Developer.

I am currently in my first year of my BSc Digital and Technology apprenticeship with PebblePad. At PebblePad I will be developing my skills as a software engineer and gaining valuable workplace experience which is important to me because I will be able learn the day to days of being a software engineer. Alongside that I'm also doing my degree in Digital and Technology solutions which will help further develop my core programming. 

I enjoy a range of programming such as C#, Web development, Web API and Microservices.

**johnmason27/johnmason27** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a website using a NES 64 themed libary (https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css). I found this libary and beleive it looks very cool so wanted to create some sort of website using it so I'm going to make a NES 64 themed bug tracker. Which maybe eventually I could make 3 teired.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning alongside all my work at PebblePad I'm researching into RabbitMQ and microservices. I'm doing this to make my web applications 3 teired and provide much more functionaltity to it. The web application is a blogsite so I have the frontend talking to an API to use the microservices. That is something I've been enjoying and will be continuing to develop.
As well as that I'm constantly learning new things during the day at my apprenticeship and we're going to be doing a web topic next so I expect to learn quick a few new things about Web development in the near future.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I enjoy frontend and backend projects.
