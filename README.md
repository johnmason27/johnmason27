## Hi there 👋
I work at PebblePad as a Apprentice Application Developer.

I am currently in my first year of my BSc Digital and Technology apprenticeship with PebblePad. At PebblePad I will be developing my skills as a software engineer and gaining valuable workplace experience which is important to me because I will be able learn the day to days of being a software engineer. Alongside that I'm also doing my degree in Digital and Technology solutions which will help further develop my core programming. 

I enjoy all sorts of programming!
