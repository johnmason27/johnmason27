## Hi, I'm John 🏃‍♂️👋
I'm an Application Developer working for PebblePad. I am currently in my first year of my BSc Digital and Technology degree. I enjoy exploring new technologies and creating applications that I think are cool and interesting. Some technologies I enjoy to work with the most include C#, ReactJS, GraphQL and distributed systems.
